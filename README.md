# Hi there, I’m Jai Awasthi 👋  
Aspiring Software Developer & AI Engineer building scalable, testable systems with real-world impact.

## 🔍 Who I Am  
I’m currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer & Communication Engineering at **LNMIIT** (Jaipur, India), and I’m passionate about stepping into a full-time Software Development Engineer role where I can ship backend-to-frontend features, integrate modern AI tools, and collaborate on production-grade systems.

## 🛠 What I Build  
- **Backend APIs & Microservices** – I’ve built RESTful endpoints using FastAPI, optimized performance through modular pipelines, and implemented clean architecture to support evolving product needs.  
- **AI/ML Systems & RAG Workflows** – From retrieval-augmented generation to knowledge-distillation pipelines, I combine ML/AI with engineering best practices.  
- **Data & Analytics Tools** – I design dashboards, transform raw data, and expose actionable insights through clean visualizations and interactive UIs.  
- **Reliable Code & Dev Practices** – I write unit/integration tests, use version control (Git), and focus on maintainability, readability and performance.

## 🧩 Key Projects  
### ResearchMate – RAG-Based Research Paper Q&A System  
Built a full stack system that ingests research documents, indexes semantic vectors, and serves context-aware answers via local LLMs. Tech: Python • FastAPI • ChromaDB • Streamlit.

### Brain Age Prediction using T1-Weighted MRI  
Developed preprocessing pipelines (normalization, feature extraction), deep regression models and evaluation modules to estimate brain age and detect anomalies. Tech: Python • PyTorch • Nibabel • Scikit-learn.

### Document Categorization with Knowledge Distillation  
Compressed a BERT model into a lightweight CNN (100× fewer parameters) while maintaining competitive accuracy. Engineered evaluation frameworks and testing utilities. Tech: Python • PyTorch • BERT • CNNs.
